# ps2toolchain-ee

This program will automatically build and install a EE compiler, which is used in the creation of homebrew software for the Sony PlayStationÂ® 2 videogame system.

## **ATTENTION**

If you're trying to install in your machine the **WHOLE PS2 Development Environment**, this is **NOT** the repo to use! Instead, you should use instead the [ps2dev](https://github.com/ps2dev/ps2dev "ps2dev") repo.

## What these scripts do

These scripts download (with `git clone`) and install [binutils 2.36.0](http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/ "binutils") (ee), [gcc 11.1.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/ "gcc") (ee), [newlib 4.1.0](https://sourceware.org/newlib/ "newlib") (ee).

## Requirements

1.  Install gcc/clang, make, patch, git, and texinfo if you don't have those packages.
2.  Ensure that you have enough permissions for managing PS2DEV location (which defaults to `/usr/local/ps2dev`). PS2DEV location MUST NOT have spaces or special characters in its path! For example, on Linux systems, you can set access for the current user by running commands:
```bash
export PS2DEV=/usr/local/ps2dev
sudo mkdir -p $PS2DEV
sudo chown -R $USER: $PS2DEV
```
3.  Add this to your login script (example: `~/.bash_profile`)
```bash
export PS2DEV=/usr/local/ps2dev
export PS2SDK=$PS2DEV/ps2sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$PS2DEV/ee/bin
```
4.  Run toolchain.sh
    `./toolchain.sh`
